                        The dark dingy corners of the prison pressed in around him and the walls seemed to spin as he choked down some pills. 
                        <br><br><br>
                        "Ugh... Is this what every day is like?" He muttered, teetering on one leg. "Stupid Sentries, First they steal our planet, then they force us into jails. DUMB SYNTHETIC ROBOTS!!!" He rambled, dangerously close to losing balance. "If only I cou--"

                        He curiously viewed the robot, looking looking for signs of hostility. Cautiously finding a meaning for the robot, he turned it over. Revealing a single grenade...

                        The smoke filled blast from the grenade poured out of the steaming hot vent system which was quickly turned into rubble as he hit the ground with a thud.
                        <br><br><br>
                        "Well that was very effecti--" Sputtering as he coughed up smoke and dust.
                        <br><br><br>
                        Taking a careful step forward, he looked over to the rubble that surrounded him. He was only just looking around when he heard an ear-piercing alarm starting to ring and the very concrete supporting his feet, crumbled and send him crashing down through the many underground floors.

                        He grabbed onto the pasty indigo and burnt orange helm of the ship and blasted his way out of the dock and towards a reddish outpost that orbited a nearby moon until a death sentence seemed to strike out of nowhere. He certainly wasn't setting sail anytime soon.

                        A roar of electron charged bullets threw themselves at the hull of the ship ripping it apart in seconds.

                        The little robot, curled up in the corner was scared from the ship essentially being crushed by negative ions. ______ grabbed the little robot up and sat it up on his lap attempting to comfort the poor thing.

                        “It’s going to be alright” ______ stated, knowing he was lying.

                        As the ship got closer to being totalled, they ultimately were approaching the outpost at dangerous speeds.

                        The ship laid submerged under 3ft of rock and dirt. As _____ stumbled out of the crashed ship he noticed the robot, scratched and dirty but functioning. He practically crawled to the robot unable to stand without becoming dizzy. 
                        <br><br><br>
                        After closely inspecting the robot, the damage was more severe than he once thought. The back panel had slid off and revealed a large damaged section of electronic components. 
                        <br><br><br>
                        On the front display, a low battery icon showed before the screen flickered and died. 
                        <br><br><br>
                        He looked to the sky and there was not a ship in sight.
                        <br><br><br>
                        Then he looked at the ground. Finding that the moon they planned to land on was now much more different to what they saw coming. And after looking at the scanners, they found out exactly where they were…..

                        The rod hissed and buzzed as if it contained a living creature; the red metal glistening with electricity.

                        He bundled up the small shards of the still active substance and gently placed them down by the dead robot’s shell. 
                        The electronic parts rattled and fused together, raising into the air as if the electricity had a mind of its own. Only to turn into a liquid and fall onto the robots damaged back panel.

                        The eyes lit up in an instant, filled with life it never had. The robot was taller and more like a human now but it was still a short little thing. 
                        <br><br><br>
                        The electronic panel had folded into a metal panel that could now be lifted up. The rest of the robot turned into this little human with 2 green glowing eyes and 2 antennae. 
                        <br><br><br>
                        Upon opening the panel, the user could see through the robot’s eyes, adding a layer of functionality like object and material tracking.
